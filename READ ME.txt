My project is about comparing coccolithophore biomass in the Indian Ocean to the Tropical Atlantic and seeing how it relates to rising sea surface temperature. I hypothesised that biomass would decrease in oceans with higher temperatures due to calcium carbonate being impacted. I found that biomass does not decrease as dirastically at the equator due to cold water being upwelled and there is a realtionship showing a downward trend in biomass as sea surface temperature increases.
